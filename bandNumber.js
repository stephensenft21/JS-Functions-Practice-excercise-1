// Your job is to write a function that accepts any band name as an argument. The function will increment a global variable by one each time it is invoked, and return that number, and the band name concatenated together.

let bandNumber = 1

const takeNumber = function (bandName) {
    console.log(`${bandNumber}. ${bandName}`);
    bandNumber++;
}

const scum = takeNumber("Galactic Scum")
console.log(scum)  // This should print "1. Galactic Scum" in the console

const under = takeNumber("Underdogs")
console.log(under)  // This should print "2. Underdogs" in the console
